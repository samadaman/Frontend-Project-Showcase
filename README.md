# Web Development Projects

This repository contains a collection of my personal web development projects, each demonstrating different functionalities, web technologies, and concepts. Below is a brief overview of each project included in this repository:

---

### üì° **Weather API**
*This project integrates a weather API to display real-time weather information based on user input.*

- Users can search for a city, and the app will fetch and display the current weather conditions.
- The weather data includes information like temperature, humidity, and a weather description.
- *Technologies used:* JavaScript, API integration, JSON handling

---

### üñºÔ∏è **Unsplash API**
*In this project, I utilize the Unsplash API to fetch and display high-quality images based on user queries.*

- Users can search for specific keywords or categories, and the app will display a gallery of relevant images.
- This project demonstrates how to work with third-party APIs and dynamically load content into a web application.
- *Technologies used:* JavaScript, API integration, dynamic content rendering

---

### üíæ **Local Storage Form**
*This is a simple form that saves user input to the browser's local storage.*

- Users can fill out the form, and their data will persist even after refreshing or reopening the page.
- Demonstrates how to use `localStorage` for storing data on the client side.
- *Technologies used:* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, localStorage API

---

### ‚è≥ **Skeleton Body**
*The Skeleton Body project implements a skeleton screen to improve user experience while content loads.*

- A skeleton screen is shown as a placeholder while the content is being fetched asynchronously.
- This design pattern provides a smoother, more responsive experience for users.
- *Technologies used:* CSS, asynchronous data loading, UX/UI design

---

### üîë **Unmatched Password (Password Re-entry Validation)**
*This project ensures that users correctly re-enter their password during form submission.*

- If the passwords don't match, the app will prompt the user to correct the error before proceeding.
- Demonstrates form validation, error handling, and secure password input practices.
- *Technologies used:* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, form validation

---

### üåô **Dark Mode Navigation**
*This project features a navigation bar that allows users to switch between light and dark modes.*

- The theme can be toggled using JavaScript, and the user's choice is saved to `localStorage`, so it persists across page reloads.
- Demonstrates how to implement dark mode and store user preferences on the client side.
- *Technologies used:* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, localStorage API

---

### üìù **Summary**
Each of these projects demonstrates a different aspect of web development, from API integration to form validation and user interface enhancements. Feel free to explore the code and see how these functionalities are implemented.
